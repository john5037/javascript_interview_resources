# CSS Interview Questions
➡️ Explain the difference between inline, internal, and external CSS.
  Inline CSS is applied directly within HTML elements, internal CSS is placed in the head section of an HTML document, and external CSS is 
  stored in separate CSS files and linked to HTML documents. 
➡️ What are the different types of CSS selectors?
  CSS selectors include element selectors, class selectors, ID selectors, attribute selectors, and pseudo-class selectors.
➡️ How do you apply CSS styles to specific elements based on their class or ID?
  To apply CSS styles to specific elements based on their class, use the class selector (e.g., ".classname") and for specific elements 
  based on their ID, use the ID selector (e.g., "#elementID").
➡️ What is the box model in CSS and how does it work?
  The box model in CSS defines how elements are rendered, including content, padding, border, and margin.
➡️ How do you center an element horizontally and vertically in CSS?
  To center an element horizontally, use "margin: 0 auto," and to center it vertically, use "display: flex; align-items: center; justify- 
  content: center."
➡️ What are pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements in CSS?
  Pseudo-classes select elements based on their state or position, while pseudo-elements style specific parts of elements (e.g., :hover, 
  :first-child, ::before).
➡️ Explain the concept of specificity in CSS.
  Specificity determines which CSS rules take precedence when multiple rules target the same element, based on the selectors used.
➡️ What is the difference between margin and padding in CSS?
  Margin is the space outside the border of an element, while padding is the space between the content and the border of an element.
➡️ How do you create a responsive layout in CSS?
  Create a responsive layout by using media queries, relative units (such as percentages), and CSS grid or flexbox.
➡️ What are media queries in CSS and how do they work?
  Media queries allow CSS rules to be applied based on the characteristics of the device or browser, such as screen width or device 
  orientation.
➡️ How do you handle browser compatibility issues in CSS?
  Handle browser compatibility by using CSS feature detection, vendor prefixes, and polyfills.
➡️ What is the difference between absolute and relative positioning in CSS?
  Absolute positioning removes an element from the normal flow and positions it relative to its containing element, while relative 
  positioning positions an element relative to its normal position in the document flow.
➡️ How do you create a CSS animation or transition?
  CSS animations and transitions can be created using keyframes and the animation or transition properties, respectively.
➡️ Explain the concept of flexbox in CSS and how it can be used for layout.
  Flexbox is a CSS layout module that provides a flexible way to arrange and align elements within a container.
➡️ What is the purpose of CSS preprocessors like Sass or Less?
  CSS preprocessors like Sass or Less enhance CSS by adding features such as variables, nesting, and mixins.
➡️ How do you optimize CSS for performance?
  Optimize CSS performance by minimizing file size, reducing the number of HTTP requests, and using efficient selectors and property values.
➡️ What is the difference between CSS grid and flexbox?
  CSS grid is a two-dimensional layout system, while flexbox is a one-dimensional layout system primarily used for arranging elements in a 
  single row or column.
➡️ How do you handle CSS specificity conflicts?
  Handle CSS specificity conflicts by using more specific selectors or by using !important, although it is generally recommended to avoid 
  !important.
➡️ Explain the concept of CSS vendor prefixes and why they are used.
  CSS vendor prefixes are used to add browser-specific prefixes to CSS properties and values to ensure compatibility with different browser 
  versions and implementations.
